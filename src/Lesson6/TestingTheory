Testing Theory
==============

Goals of Testing:
1)"Complete Code Coverage": It's impossible for every line in your code
to be executed inn one run (ex - if statements). The goal is to ensure 
that every line gets run at least once. Requires several trails.
2) Efficiency: Testers want to avoid using test data that belongs 
to the same "Equivalence Class". This is data that will send you 
down the same path of execution each time you run the program.

Strategies:
1) Test "Boundary Conditions". This is the data that falls
right on or near boundaries. Ex -Number must be 10-20, so
test 9,10,11,19,20,21
2) Test with "Extreme Conditions". This is data that is far away
from acceptable limits. Ex - test 1 million or -1 million

Testing Payroll Interface
Boundaries:
Type - try 0,1,2,3
Rate _ try 6.74, 6.75, 30.50, 30.51
Hours - try -1, 0 , 1 ,59, 60, 61

Extreme
Type - try -1000 +100
Rate - try-100 +100
Hours - try -100, +100
